# Subscriptions

Monthly pay model, in which users pay a set price every period

## Our Stance

We would try to stay away from any subscription model, unless it provides a massive benefit to our users.
Which upon writing I really can't think of a circumstance it would.

We do not like subscription models, We think pay once get content is more beneficial for our players (maybe not as beneficial for us though).

Our players come first, and we disagree with any practice that requires constant money to enjoy the content which has already been paid for.
