# DRM

Digital Rights Management

Protection measures that are a set of access control technologies for restricting the use of copyrighted works.

### Umm What??

DRM allows creators to protect themselves from piracy.

### Our Policy

We think DRM is fair and helps us make sure the hardwork we put into games.

Our games are published through Steam which is a DRM platform. It handles licensing and account activation of games for us.

### Always Online DRM

No just simply no, We will never create a game that unnecessary has always online DRM.

  > Unnecessary, that seems like a gray area term?

The only games that will require an internet connection to play, would be games where the only way to play is online.
For example a battle-royale style game, with no single-player features. This would always require a internet connection to be able to play with other people.

### Delisting

If our games are ever removed from a DRM platforma and are no longer avaliable for sale.
We will release a DRM free version.

We would hate for a fan not to be able to play their favorite gmae of ours!
